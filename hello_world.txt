I got my eyes on you 
You are everything that I see 
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly
I can't get over you 
You left your mark on me 
I want your hot love and emotion, endlessly 
Cause you're a good girl and you know it
You act so different around me
Cause you're good girl and you know it 
I know exactly who you could be
